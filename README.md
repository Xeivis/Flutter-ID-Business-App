# Custom ID App

This project is an experiment created with the purpose to learn and improve my development skills in Dart/Flutter.

It's meant to be able to craeate a custom display ID to show arround while at a convetion, social gathering or event of the sort.

~~Right now (19/03/2024) it only has a main screen that has mock data info, and it doesn't support any kind of personalitzation aside from the theme and resizing of the window.~~

As per the Provider brach merge (21/04/2024) you can now customise every part of the main view, including texts, images and colors. (Although the web version still won't let you change the image).
